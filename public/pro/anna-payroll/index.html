                I designed the step as an interactive payslip because this is
                intuitive and familiar.

                Also, I made onboarding content skippable, and non-linear, so
                that users can try running payroll even if they didn’t have all
                the right details initially. The aim was to increase engagement
                early on, resulting in filing conversion (a key metric).

                Customers told us they were afraid of missing payroll deadlines,
                so I built in guard-rails to protect them. I defined emails and
                dashboard cards that reminded users when payroll tasks were due.
                I’m happy writing copy, so I wrote all this up before giving it
                to a copy-writer to check it.
